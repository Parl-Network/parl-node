## How to build

Building this project requires a working [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (stable) toolchain.

It's expected to be cross-platform and guaranteed to work on Linux, Windows, MacOS platforms.

### Build from sub project
Go to one of following folder you want to build from source: `parl_daemon`, `parl_miner` or `parl_wallet`.
To build a release (optimized) version:
`cargo build --release`

### Build from workspace
To build a version from workspace (parent folder) directly, use the option `--bin` with `parl_daemon`, `parl_miner` or `parl_wallet` as value.
Example: `cargo build --release --bin parl_miner`

You can also build a debug version (just remove `--release` option) or run it directly from cargo:
`cargo run`

## Funding

Current dev fee curve is as following:

- 10% from block 0 to 3 000 000 (expected time is one year with side blocks from blockDAG and network growing)
- 5% from 3 000 001 until the project being developed and stable enough to reduce it.
